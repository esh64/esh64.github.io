	    <h1>Academic Trajectory</h1>
	    <p>Born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, I have been interested in computers and video games since childhood. My curiosity about math and science started early in elementary school. At 13, I began programming in Python. Since then, I have explored different areas of computing on my own, including web game development.</p>
	
	    <p>During high school at CEFET (2012–2014), my interest in computing grew stronger. In my final year, I participated in a research project focused on educational technology, where I helped develop a mobile application to teach vector concepts in high school physics. The app generated random vector exercises for students, and their performance statistics were sent to teachers for analysis.</p>
	
	    <p>Uncertain about which field to pursue, I started my studies in the BCMT (Bachelor of Mathematics and Earth Sciences) program at UFRJ in 2015. There, I was exposed to various subjects like mathematics, geology, astronomy, and chemistry, which broadened my academic perspective.</p>
	
	    <p>In 2017, motivated by my interest in retro gaming and computers, I switched to the Electronic and Computer Engineering program. During my second semester, I took a course on Digital Systems, which caught my attention. Around that time, I had been invited to join two research projects but hadn't felt particularly drawn to them. After completing the course, I reached out to the professor to learn more, and he invited me to join a research project in a different area. From then on, I became involved in research on Machine Learning, Digital Signal Processing, and Computer Vision. </p>
	
	    <p>My first research project focused on novelty detection in passive sonar systems using machine learning, particularly deep learning models. This introduced me to data science and machine learning, where I explored various techniques and tools. The second project, which I started a year later, was about developing intelligent computer vision solutions for embedded systems to help prevent electrical pole failures in remote areas. This experience involved working with OpenCV and optimizing memory usage for real-time image processing and transmission.</p>
	
	    <p>In 2023, I moved to São Carlos, São Paulo, to start a master's degree at ICMC-USP, as I had developed a strong interest in robotics. My research focused on exploring attention mechanisms for multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles. The goal was to build upon BEVFusion by simplifying the image-processing backbone to reduce computational costs while compensating for performance loss using attention-based feature enhancement.</p>
	
	    <p>Although I find robotics interesting and a growing field, I realized that career opportunities in this area, particularly in computer science, are somewhat limited in academia. In 2024, while working as a teaching assistant for the "Practical Digital Systems" course, I noticed that this field—one that I had enjoyed during my undergraduate studies—offered more teaching and research opportunities, even though it has a smaller community compared to robotics and machine learning.</p>
	
	    <p>Because of this, in 2025, I started a PhD in Computer Science at ICMC-USP, where I am working on developing a general-purpose Data Flow-based computer architecture.</p>
	
	    <p>Despite focusing on Data Flow architectures, I continue to explore Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Signal Processing independently, particularly for applications in robotics and biomedical engineering, hoping to align these interests in the future.</p>
