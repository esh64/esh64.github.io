    <h1>Eduardo Sperle Honorato</h1>
    
    <p>Born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Passionate about computers and video games since childhood, he showed a lot of interest in math and science since elementary school. He started learning to program at age 13 with python and deepened in Computing and Informatics during high school at CEFET from 2012 to 2014.</p>
    
    <p>Not knowing what to study, in 2015 he enrolled in the undergraduate course BCMT (Bachelor of Mathematics and Earth Sciences) at UFRJ where he studied basic subjects in mathematics, geology, astronomy and chemistry where he had the opportunity to talk to several professors to learn more about the different undergraduate courses.</p>
    
    <p>In 2017, he enrolled in the Electronic and Computer Engineering undergraduate course, due to his hobby in retro gaming and his passion for computers. Since then he has carried out research in the areas of Machine Learning, Digital Signal Processing and Computer Vision, producing 4 conference papers and a journal article.</p>
